# Ecommerce Spring Application

A high-performance, microservices-based ecommerce platform built with Spring Boot, featuring scalable architecture, flexible data sourcing, and comprehensive product management.

## üèó Architecture & Technical Highlights

**Architected a microservices-based e-commerce platform** using Spring Boot, implementing service discovery and environment-based configuration management for scalable deployment across multiple environments.

**Designed a flexible gateway pattern** allowing seamless switching between internal database and external third-party APIs (FakeStore API), demonstrating adapter design principles and API abstraction layer.

**Implemented a robust product catalog system** with JPA/Hibernate, featuring:
- Complex category-product relationships with proper entity mapping
- Batch product retrieval optimized for performance
- Comprehensive CRUD operations with validation
- Advanced querying capabilities for product search and filtering

**Developed enterprise-grade RESTful APIs** with:
- Proper entity relationships and DTO mapping patterns
- Comprehensive exception handling and error responses
- Structured API documentation following OpenAPI standards
- Efficient data transfer between layers

**Built a generic base entity system** with automated auditing using Spring Data JPA, ensuring consistent timestamp tracking (createdAt, updatedAt) across all domain models with minimal code duplication.

**Created specialized API endpoints** for complex business queries including:
- Product-category joins with optimized database queries
- Batch product lookups for shopping cart functionality
- Inventory management with stock tracking
- Advanced search with multiple filter criteria
